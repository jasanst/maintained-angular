# Maintained Angular Projects

Angular 1 and 2 have changed massively since their inception but not all projects have been maintained, this list is intended to showcase those authors who keep their applications up-to-date using the latest best practices.

For Angular 1 this means using the component tree structure.

For Angular 2 they should use ngModule.

Tests and a modern build chain highly rated too.
